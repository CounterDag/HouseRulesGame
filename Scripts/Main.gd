#selection code
#when left clicked, move piecemarker from piecepositionplaced to piecepositionselected
#Then, highlight all legal moves.
#if canceled (right click? Cancel button?), move from piece positionselected to piecepositionplaced
#if a legal move is selected, do move
#otherwise, do nothing
#Main needs to know what legal moves are. That should be passed from the pieces themselves.
